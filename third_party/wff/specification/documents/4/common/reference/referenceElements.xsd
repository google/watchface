        Reference is a new element which can be placed under any scene object supporting Transform.
        Reference allows you to publish Transformable attributes from a source element,
        which can be consumed as a DataSource in other expressions within your Scene.
        The element has three attributes: name, source attribute's name and default value.

        "Reference" can be referenced in other expressions, such as DataSource, and 'REFERENCE' prefix and name are used.
        e.g., To consume a Reference, use [REFERENCE.reference_name] in your expressions.
        The result of this equals to the value of the source attribute of the referenced object.

        NOTE.
        The reference name is the identifier of the reference, and it should be unique within the
        scope of the document.
        Do not use references as cross references or circular references. If so, it is updated only once for the first time
        and is not updated after.

        SINCE.
