          Highlight image indicating where this configuration changes. Since it will be laid on the
          watch face preview, some restrictions should be considered:
          1. Background MUST be transparent.
          2. It SHOULD be tint-able.
          3. The content SHOULD show the boundary of a part where will be changed by user style
             selection.
          4. Aspect ratio of the image SHOULD be matched to width and height of the "WatchFace"
             element. This will be stretched as fit as the preview screen.
          It is recommended to use an image considered to look the same as other watch face
          configuration screens in the watch face editor of the representative product to be
          targeted.
